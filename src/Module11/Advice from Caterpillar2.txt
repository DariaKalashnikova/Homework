The Insect and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Insect took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
�Who are you?� said the Insect.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, �I�I hardly know, sir, just at present�at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.�
�What do you mean by that?� said the Insect sternly. �Explain yourself!�
�I can�t explain myself, I�m afraid, sir� said Alice, �because I�m not myself, you see.�
�I don�t see,� said the Insect.
�I�m afraid I can�t put it more clearly,� Alice replied very politely, �for I can�t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.�
�It isn�t,� said the Insect.
�Well, perhaps you haven�t found it so yet,� said Alice; �but when you have to turn into a chrysalis�you will some day, you know�and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you�ll feel it a little queer, won�t you?�
�Not a bit,� said the Insect.
�Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,� said Alice; �all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.�
�You!� said the Insect contemptuously. �Who are you?�
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Insect�s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, �I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.�
�Why?� said the Insect.
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Insect seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
�Come back!� the Insect called after her. �I�ve something important to say!�
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
�Keep your temper,� said the Insect.
�Is that all?� said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
�No,� said the Insect.
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, �So you think you�re changed, do you?�
�I�m afraid I am, sir,� said Alice; �I can�t remember things as I used�and I don�t keep the same size for ten minutes together!�
�Can�t remember what things?� said the Insect.
�Well, I�ve tried to say �How doth the little busy bee,� but it all came different!� Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
�Repeat, �You are old, Father William,�� said the Insect.
